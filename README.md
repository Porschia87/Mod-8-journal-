1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
   An interpreting user needs will generally start with the analysis of the system. This can be done by asking the team for feedback, asking previous users for any errors or changes they should see within the code. Inputs and outputs should also be identified as well. Users stories can help with gathering this information because this is where the users can express their needs and wants. Looking at the user stories will help us understand the end users perspective.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile process do hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    It's different ways to approach developing programs. One is Waterfall method, it helps in projecting the needs of a specific strategy. Another method is Agile. Agile offers a more flexible strategy and it is more unique way to work with testing planning and client integration.

3. What does it means to a good team member in software development?
   A good team member means to make sure you are understanding your part of the project and communicate with your team members. Listen to one another and help each other out as a team should. Also keeping up to date with your part so everyone can complete on time before the deadline.
